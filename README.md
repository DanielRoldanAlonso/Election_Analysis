# Election_Analysis
## Overview

In this project we have helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. This information involved the total votes, county votes, the largest county turnout, candidate votes, and winner. Our purpose was to accurately calculate the elections through for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line in a visually understandable text file. 

## Results

- In the congressional election, there was a total of 368,711 votes. 
- From the votes, the majority came from Denver that had 306,055 votes for a 82.8% total of all 3 counties. Then Jefferson had 38,844 votes for a 10.5% of total votes and lastly, Arapahoe had 24,801 votes for a 6.7% of all votes. 
- The largest county turnout was Denver.
- From the election audit results, Diana DeGette had the most votes at 272,892 with a 73.8% majority. Then Charles Casper Stockham had 75,213 vote for a 23% of total votes and lastly, Raymon Anthony Doane had 11,606 votes for a 3.1% of all votes.

## Summary

From our results, we were able to accurately calculate several metrics and provide visual representation of these elections. Fortunately, this can be done once again with the same script. We suggest that the election commission reuse this script and add modifications when needed, for other elections. This script can be modified for elections that want to gather more information on counties that vote less. This would be benificial to identify where the election commission can spend more of there time encouraging people to vote. This script can also be modified to identify the amount of votes for each candidate in each state. This is to provide further detailed information on the candidates popularity per county.
