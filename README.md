# Election_Analysis
## Overview

In this project we have helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. This information involved the total votes, county votes, the largest county turnout, candidate votes, and winner. Our purpose was to accurately calculate the elections through for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line in a visually understandable text file.
